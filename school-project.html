            <h2>My Accomplishments:</h2>
            <p>Most my accomplishments is in the form of how my websites have evolved since the time I started web developement. In the 1 year of when I started, my websites went from simple text with an broken image as the background to many html elements with each having their own piece of css and to having javascript activate or deactivate html elements with a timer at standby. If you were to go back to my old websites, you would see the same page, but it's not the same. The iframe below, is able to show what I am now able to do. <i>Note that some elements were deactivated prior to me using the website as the example.</i> <i style="color:transparent;">Did you know, that this website is using newer skills that I've obtained.</i></p>
