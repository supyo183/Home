            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>I am a web developer who literally makes websites for fun. Many of my projects were of me using newer knowledge that I've learned and combining them with the knowledge that I had at the time. My experiance is only in web development and I have no form of education for it except for me being self taught. My current vision is to one day make a sucessful game, while my goal is to learn more programming languages and eventually enter game developement.</p>

            <h2>My Accomplishments:</h2>
            <p>I have accomplished many things during my 1 year of coding. I have many websites which all have a very similar look, but trust me, their sources are not the same. The iframe is currently the only evidence that I have as it is a collection of everything that I have made and used. The iframe also happens to be my best website from since I started web development. <i>Note that some elements were deactivated prior to me using the website as the example.</i> <i style="color:transparent;">Fun fact, that this website is using newer skills that I've obtained.</i></p>
